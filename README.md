## 🧠 The Problem

Millions of people face overlapping challenges:

- Mental health issues like anxiety, stress, and burnout.
- Trouble focusing due to emotional or environmental distractions.
- Financial instability that worsens emotional well-being.

These struggles are often treated separately, leading to scattered tools and incomplete support.
